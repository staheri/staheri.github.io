# Untitled

I am walking through AST of a go source code (fibonacci) that has all the primitives that I need to keep track of for instrumentation. As a simple experiment, I want to inject instrumentation to the fibonacci so that:

- A main text trace file holds information about:
   * channels:
      + creation (name, type, capacity, location)
      + send (sender name, value)
      + receive (receiver name, value)
      + close (name, location)
   * select:
      + subsequent channels
      + default
   * functions:
- Any time a "go" keyword identified, a new text trace file is created to hold the above information for the newly spawned goroutine
