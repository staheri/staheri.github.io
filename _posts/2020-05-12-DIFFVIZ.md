# Why diffing?

If I want to explain my Ph.D. work for my nephew in his sixth grade in the simplest way, I would say "I am making software for other computer programmers to **understand** their program and its behavior". That would pretty much wrap up my work as I am applying different techniques to convert *raw execution traces* to *meaningful information* that brings insight into the actual behavior of the program.

Programmers often have a general picture of the program characteristics in their mind and on the way to its completion, they gradually *check* the behavior with their expectations using simple features like [printf debugging](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~fsieker/misc/debug/DEBUG.html):

> “The most effective debugging tool is still careful thought, coupled with judiciously placed print statements.” — Brian Kernighan, “Unix for Beginners” (1979)

The process of printf debugging is to virtually compare (i.e., [diff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff)) the *expected* vs. *executed* behavior. This is the core idea of [DiffTrace](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8891027), the tool-chain that we designed and implemented to locate flaws in HPC applications. We used different techniques to find trace files (or source codes) that has changed the most when a bug is introduced or the program misbehaved. Then we wanted to see what are the **actual points of differences** between a *good* (or successful) execution and its counterpart *bad* (or buggy) execution. That is why we implemented diffViz.

# diffViz

To highlight the differences in an easy-to-understand manner, diffViz visually separates the common and different blocks of a pair of pre-processed traces (or any pair of text-based files) by implementing the [*diff* algorithm](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01840446).
*diff* takes two sequences A and B and computes the minimal edit to convert A to B. This algorithm is used in the [GNU diff](https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/) utility to compare two text files and in [git](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff) for efficiently keeping track of file changes.
diffViz aligns common and different blocks of a pair of sequences (e.g., traces) horizontally and vertically, making it easier for the analyst to see the differences at a glance.
