I am almost a Ph.D. Candidate at [School of Computing](http://cs.utah.edu) - [University of Utah](http://utah.edu). I am a member of [Formal Verification Group](http://formalverification.cs.utah.edu/new/) under supervision of [Dr. Ganesh Gopalakrishnan](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~ganesh/). My Research interest is Parallel and HPC Programming and Debugging (MPI, OpenMP, CUDA, etc.). Currently I am working on a whole-program tracing framework for HPC debugging.
