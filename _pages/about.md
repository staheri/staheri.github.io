I just defended my Ph.D. at [School of Computing](http://cs.utah.edu) - [University of Utah](http://utah.edu), as a member of [Formal Verification Group](http://formalverification.cs.utah.edu/new/) under supervision of [Dr. Ganesh Gopalakrishnan](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~ganesh/). The title of Ph.D. dissertation is "Debugging and Analysis Tools for Concurrent Programs". I have created three software systems: DiffTrace, ParLOT and GOAT (TBC).
