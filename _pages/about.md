I am a Ph.D. candidate at [School of Computing](http://cs.utah.edu) - [University of Utah](http://utah.edu). I am a member of [Formal Verification Group](http://formalverification.cs.utah.edu/new/) under supervision of [Dr. Ganesh Gopalakrishnan](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~ganesh/). The general theme of my Ph.D. is on designing "Debuggers" for parallel applications. I collect different type of dynamic traces (e.g., evidence) efficiently, and systematically analyze traces to bring intuition about the behavior of the program to the developer. My interests are HPC debugging mechanism with a focus on hybrid applications (distributed and shared memory). Currently I am working on concurrent bugs in golang.
